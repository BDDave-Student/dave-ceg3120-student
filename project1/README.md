Brandon's classwork for the class CEG3120

##Project 1:</br>
My main focus on Project 1 is to create a script that is the be-all-that-ends-all for creating a personalized server and user directory based on my preferences.<br>

Running bddStartUp will:</br>
1) Create a scripts directory PATH to the user's environment</br>
2) Create and store an alias aws-ssh to .bashrc that will allow the user to quickly access the ubuntu server given they have access to the key.</br>
3) Create and store an alias re-alias to .bashrc that will allow the user to remove all unstored aliases and refresh their alias with only stored aliases within the .bashrc</br>
