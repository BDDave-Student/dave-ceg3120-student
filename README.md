## Brandon's classwork for the class CEG3120
### Project 1:
The purpose of this project was to act as an introductory into the Linux BASH environment while also re-visiting the scripting language.  The bddStartUp.sh bash script is ideally the only script I will need to run in order to get any and all environments set up to my preference.  This includes pre-setting aliases, color options, adding a quirky MOTD, and so on and so forth.

## Project 2:
The purpose of this project was to simulate a company's needs and accessibility to different services hosted on varying machines utilizing AWS.
